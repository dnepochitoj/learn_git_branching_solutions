# 2.2.5._git_push_arguments_--_expanded!

In order to specify both the source and the destination of <place>, simply join the two together with a colon:

$ git push origin <source>:<destination>

This is commonly referred to as a colon refspec. Refspec is just a fancy name for a location that git can figure out (like the branch foo or even just HEAD~1).

## my solution

$ git push origin C5:foo
$ git push origin foo:main

## proposed solution

$ git push origin main^:foo
$ git push origin foo:main
