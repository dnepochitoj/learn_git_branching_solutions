# 2.2.6._fetch_arguments

`git fetch origin <source>:<destination>` - <source> is now a place on the remote and <destination> is a local place to put those commits. It's the exact opposite of `git push`, and that makes sense since we are transferring data in the opposite direction!

## my solution

$ git fetch origin C3:foo
$ git fetch origin C6:main
$ git merge foo
    Fast forwarding...
$ git merge main
$ git rebase HEAD foo

## proposed solution

$ git fetch origin c3:foo
$ git fetch origin c6:main
$ git checkout foo
$ git merge main
