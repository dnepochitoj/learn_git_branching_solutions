# 2.1.8._locked_main

Why was it rejected?

The remote rejected the push of commits directly to main because of the policy on main requiring pull requests to instead be used.

You meant to follow the process creating a branch then pushing that branch and doing a pull request, but you forgot and committed directly to main. Now you are stuck and cannot push your changes.

The solution

Create another branch called feature and push that to the remote. Also reset your main back to be in sync with the remote otherwise you may have issues next time you do a pull and someone else's commit conflicts with yours.

## my solution

$ git branch feature
$ git branch -f main HEAD^
$ git checkout feature
$ git push

## proposed solution

$ git reset --hard o/main
$ git checkout -b feature C2
$ git push origin feature
    local branch "feature" set to track remote branch "o/feature"
